This project is a collection of the code, graphs and analyses that i've created while trying to answer some questions about the video games such as "Valorant" and "Counter-Strike Global Offensive" along with their esports domains

I've added a short description (question being answered, analysis methods used, conclusion, other thoughts) for each file
